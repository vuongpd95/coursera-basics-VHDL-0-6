# Nand2Tetris: Chapter 1-6

This is my solution for the first 6 chapters of the project-centered course "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris" offered by Coursera. I did this in my second year of college when learning about Computer Architecture. This is a very fun project from which I have learnt about some VHDL basics and how the computer is built.

You can learn more about Nand2Tetris from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) and its [official companion website](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)

You may want to finish the course before reading my solution to get the best experience.
